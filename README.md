WorldEdit for LilyBukkit project
=========

This is a project to port [WorldEdit](https://enginehub.org/worldedit/) to the [LilyBukkit](https://github.com/Vladg24YT/LilyBukkit) server software.
"WorldEdit is a voxel and block manipulation library for Minecraft. It is
primarily a library but bindings to Bukkit (included) and SPC (external)
are available."

Compiling
---------

You need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) and [JDK 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&package=jdk) installed. Once installed,
simply run:

    mvn package --file pom.xml
    
Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
